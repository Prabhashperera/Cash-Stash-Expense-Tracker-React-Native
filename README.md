# 💰 CashStash - Mobile Expense Tracker

**CashStash** is a modern, full-stack mobile application built with **React Native** and **Firebase**. It is designed to help users track their income and expenses with ease, providing real-time feedback on their financial health through a "Smart Budgeting" system.

## 🚀 Creativity & Innovation 
Beyond the basic CRUD requirements, CashStash includes several innovative features:

* **Smart Budget Nudge (Notification System):** The app monitors your running balance. If an expense causes your balance to drop below **Rs. 1,000**, a custom warning banner is triggered to alert the user.
* **Proactive UI Feedback:** Uses an in-app banner system rather than intrusive modals to maintain a smooth user experience.
* **Real-time Analytics:** Integrated Firestore listeners to provide instant updates on income vs. expenses without manual refreshing.
* **Cloud-Sync Profile:** Support for dynamic profile management and data persistence across devices.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Frontend:** React Native (Expo SDK 53)
* **Language:** TypeScript (Strict Mode)
* **Backend:** Firebase (Firestore & Authentication)
* **Navigation:** Expo Router (File-based routing)
* **UI/UX:** React Native Safe Area Context, Ionicons, and Custom Animated Components.
